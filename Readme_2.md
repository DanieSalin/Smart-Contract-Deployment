Exercise 2: Smart Contract Deployment 
Objective: 
â€¢ Deploy smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain using Python. 
Tasks: 
1. Write a Solidity smart contract defining basic functionality (e.g., a token contract, a 
simple voting contract). 
2. Compile the smart contract using solc, the Solidity compiler. 
3. Initialize a connection to an Ethereum node using web3.py. 
4. Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using web3.py. 
5. Verify the successful deployment by retrieving the contract's address and bytecode. 
6. Interact with the deployed smart contract using Python to perform various transactions 
and calls.
